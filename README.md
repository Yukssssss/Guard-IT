# Guard-IT | Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) 
*Note: This is a beta version and a work in progress. Some features may be incomplete or subject to change.*


## Prerequisites
Before using the application, ensure you have the following:

- Npcap Library installed on your system.
- Compatible system with wxWidgets.
- Visual Studio for development (if using the source code).
- You can use de .exe to run the application

## Project Description
This project aims to create a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) capable of monitoring network traffic, capturing packets, and identifying potential threats. It provides a user-friendly interface to configure and observe real-time network activities.

## Usage

Follow these steps to effectively use the NIDS application:

1. **Select Network Interface:**
   Use the "Network Interface" dropdown to choose the network card for monitoring.
2. **Filter by IP Address:**
   Enter the desired IP address in the "IP Address" text box to filter traffic.
3. **Set Capture Frequency:**
   Use the "Set Frequency" button to define the capture frequency in milliseconds.
4. **Start and Stop Capture:**
   Utilize the "Start Capture" and "Stop Capture" buttons to initiate and terminate traffic monitoring.
5. **Real-time Traffic Observation:**
   The "Traffic Log" list displays real-time details of captured packets.
6. **Filter by Protocol and Threat:**
   Use the "Protocol" and "Threat" columns to identify packets by protocol and potential threats.


## Project Context
This project was developed as part of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science during the second year of studies. It aims to showcase practical skills in network security and software development.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure the selected network card is correct.
- If you want to ask me a question you can contact me 

With these simple steps, you are ready to use the Guard IT application to monitor network traffic on the selected card. Explore packet details and be aware of any potential threats or suspicious activities.
